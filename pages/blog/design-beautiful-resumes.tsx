              Follow these 16 pro tips to help your design resume stand out from
              the crowd.

            <p className="mt-2">
              With designers fighting it out for every job that comes along,
              it's important that you stand out from the crowd. Whether you're
              just starting out or a seasoned pro applying for a better
              position, your design resume needs to be first rate for you to
              stand a chance of getting an interview.
            </p>
            <p className="my-2">
              For your design resume to really shine, you need to think
              carefully about how it's designed as well as what's written. Here,
              we'll cover both, as we walk you through the process of creating a
              stellar designer resume. You'll be landing that dream design job
              in no time.

            <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">1. Avoid word processors</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Microsoft Word might be okay if you’re applying for an admin
              position, but if you’re after a design job or something creative,
              its limited and idiosyncratic layout options just won't cut it.
              Art directors will be paying close attention to the layout of your
              resume as much as the content, so use InDesign CC or even
              Illustrator CC to design something special.
            </p>
            <p className="my-2">
              Whatever program you use to design your resume in, PDF is the best
              format to supply it in. This enables you to create good-looking
              documents that are completely cross-platform.

              2. Choose your fonts wisely
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              You’re a designer, so your resume should follow the latest trends
              in typography, right? Wrong! The aim of any resume should be
              legibility, so it’s generally a wise idea to stick to simple,
              readable fonts. You don't need to shell out lots of cash to find
              something suitable either – take a look at our list of the best
              free fonts for designers.
            </p>
            <p className="my-2">
              And if you would like to use more than one font, you can also
              check our perfect font pairings.

            <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">3. Consider using colour</h2>
            <p className="my-2">
              For most non-design-related jobs, a resume designed or printed in
              colour is probably a waste of time. However, for design positions,
              touches of colour are an acceptable way to add a discreet personal
              touch. Use colour carefully, however, and don't go over the top.
              Green type on a yellow page will stand out for all the wrong
              reasons. See our post on colour theory for more info on this.

          <div className="text-cyan-500">
            <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">4. Be brief</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Art directors do not have the time or the inclination to read your
              entire life story. Your resume should ideally fit onto one side of
              A4, and if it's any longer than two pages, you’re waffling and
              including too much stuff.
            </p>
            <p className="my-2">
              Don’t be tempted to mask a lack of experience with verbosity.
              Clean, well-laid-out resumes will always win over flabby ones -
              remember, the aim is to intrigue and impress. Point the recipient
              in the direction of an online portfolio to see more.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="text-cyan-500">
            <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">
              5. Include your contact info
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              As a minimum, your resume should include your name and contact
              details, including your email address, phone number and online
              portfolio URL. Don't assume that because these are at the bottom
              of the email you sent, you don't need to include them. Make life
              easier for your potential employer.
            </p>
            <p className="my-2">
              This should be followed by a breakdown of your work experience,
              then your education. In both cases, this should be most recent
              first. Work experience should include dates, job title and a brief
              synopsis of your role. Don't bother including jobs you did years
              ago that are irrelevant to the job you're applying for. References
              are generally optional.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="text-cyan-500">
            <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">
              6. Don't lie on your resume
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              We once received a resume from an unnamed individual who claimed
              to have created quite a stunning website. We would have been
              extremely impressed were it not for the fact that we had actually
              designed the site.
            </p>
            <p className="my-2">
              Needless to say, that resume went straight in the bin and the
              sender was rewarded with a strongly worded email. Honesty is
              always the best policy, as you stand a good chance of being found
              out if you start 'elaborating' in your resume.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="text-cyan-500">
            <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">
              7. Include samples of work
            </h2>
            <p className="my-2">
              By not including any samples of your work with your resume, you’re
              pretty much guaranteeing that the recipient will not consider you
              for the post. If you work with motion, stills are perfect, unless
              you’ve been specifically asked to include a showreel. On the other
              hand, don't go overboard with images – that's a job for your
              online graphic design portfolio, which you can provide a link to.
              Alternatively, you can provide a curated version of your portfolio
              in PDF format.
            </p>

          <div className="text-cyan-500">
            <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">8. Keep it simple</h2>
            <p className="my-2">
              Unless you’re really confident and sure about what you’re doing,
              keep the typographic flourishes and fanciful designs at bay,
              ensure the layout is simple and clear and the information is
              cleanly presented. After all, the last thing you want is the
              recipient squinting because you thought dark grey text on a black
              background was a great idea.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="text-cyan-500">
            <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">9. Show your personality</h2>
            <p className="my-2">
              Simple does not have to mean dull. A resume is a reflection of
              your disposition and persona, and the recipient will be scanning
              it, consciously or not, for elements that distinguish your resume
              from the other hundreds they have to wade through. Make your
              resume stand out with an idiosyncratic design and personal
              touches... just don't overdo it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="text-cyan-500">
            <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">
              10. Beware the novelty approach to resumes
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              We’ve had resumes written on scrunched up paper; arriving in the
              form of a jigsaw; and playing cards. We’ve had giant resume
              posters, inflatable resumes and resumes crafted using delicate and
              complex paper engineering.
            </p>
            <p className="my-2">
              Off-the-wall resumes stick in the mind (you can see some of the
              best examples in our roundup of creative resumes) but they're a
              risky proposition. On the one hand you might appear like a
              creative thinker, on the other it might seem pretentious and
              excessive. It depends on the recipient.
            </p>

          <div className="text-cyan-500">
            <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">11. Don't plagiarise</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              We've all seen this clever resume concept... so don't try to pass
              it off as your idea
            </p>
            <p className="my-2">
              A surprising number of graduates see an inspiring resume design
              concept and copy it. What can they be thinking? We all have access
              to the same internet, and if a particularly inventive resume
              design has caught your eye, there's a strong chance it's been
              shared virally within the industry and will have caught the eye of
              your potential employer, too. Your resume should showcase your
              creativity, not someone else's.

          <div className="text-cyan-500">
            <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">
              12. Use proper prints, not photocopies
            </h2>
            <p className="my-2">
              Photocopies are cheap, but sadly they also look cheap, especially
              second and third generation copies. Type starts to break up,
              images are contrasty and full of noise, fingerprints and other
              blemishes begin to show up, and the results can look slightly
              askew. Fresh laser prints or sharp inkjet prints on the best
              quality paper available are the minimum standard. For more info,
              check out our designer's guide to printing.

              13. Demonstrate consistency
            </h2>
            <p className="my-2">
              Real-world design projects are usually centred around a single,
              consistent theme or concept that runs throughout the logo,
              branding, literature and so on. Your résumé, portfolio and
              covering letter need to demonstrate the same consistency. For
              example, are bulleted lists presented in the same style across
              each of your pages? Is the colour scheme consistent?
            </p>

              14. Spend time on the covering letter
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Most of the time, when you apply for a job, your resume will need
              to be accompanied by a covering letter. This should look formal
              and business-like: this isn't the place to showcase your
              creativity and imagination. The text should complement the CV and
              it's best to keep it short and to the point (three paragraphs is a
              good rule of thumb).
            </p>
            <p className="my-2">
              Make it obvious you haven't just copied and pasted the same letter
              you've used to apply for a hundred other jobs. Write it in a way
              that's personal to the particular job and company you're applying
              for.

            </h2>
            <p className="my-2">
              If you're applying for multiple jobs, you should create multiple
              resumes, each targeting a specific role and the kind of experience
              and skills the prospective employers are looking for. To take an
              obvious example, if the job specifically mentions InDesign as a
              requirement then you should make this first on your list of
              skills, and possibly expand the description of how and where
              you've used it.

              applying for a job as a designer, does it matter how well you
              write? The simple answer is yes. Spelling and grammar mistakes
              will make you appear uneducated, ignorant and/or lazy – and none
              of these represent the image you're trying to convey. So, always
              double-check your grammar and spelling, and get others to check it
              too {"(it's easy to miss your own mistakes)"}
